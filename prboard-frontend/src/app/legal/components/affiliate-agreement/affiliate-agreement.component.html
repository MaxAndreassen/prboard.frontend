          subsection is subject to the specific terms and conditions throughout the rest of this Agreement. </b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Sign Ups:</b> We will provide you with a specific link or links, personalized to you as an Affiliate, for
        your
        promotion (collectively, " Sign-Up Link"). The Sign-Up Link will be keyed to your identity and will send online
        users to the Company's website or websites. You hereby agree to fully cooperate with us regarding the Link and
        that you will explicitly comply with all of the terms of this Agreement for the promotion of the Sign-Up Link at
        all times. We may modify the specific link or links and will notify you if we do so. You agree to only use links
        which are prior approved by us and to display the Sign-Up Link prominently on your website or social media page,
        as described in your Affiliate Application (collectively, the "Affiliate Site"). A user who signs up through
        your Sign-Up link will display your logo as their ‘Affiliate Sponsor’ on their user profile on the Website. </p>
      <p><b>No cookie stuffing:</b> You agree not to use cookie "stuffing," or other techniques which may incorporate a
        tracking code without specific knowledge of the online user. </p>
      <p>All information which will be displayed on the Affiliate Site regarding the Company must be approved by us in
        writing prior to display. </p>
      <p><b>Sales:</b> Each time a user who has signed up through your Sign-Up Link, posted on the Affiliate Site,
        completes the
        purchase of a tournament entry and we determine it is a Qualified Purchase, as described below, you will be
        eligible to receive the affiliate 'Sign-Up' cut. The affiliate 'Sign-Up' cut is worth the following percentage
        of the sale before VAT: 5% (five percent). </p>
      <p><b>Organiser:</b> Each time a user who has signed up through your Sign-Up Link, posted on the Affiliate Site,
        runs a paid tournament you will be
        eligible to receive the affiliate 'Tournament' cut. The affiliate 'Tournament' cut is worth the following
        percentage
        of a ticket sale before VAT: 5% (five percent). </p>
      <p><b>Your Events:</b> Each time any user completes a purchase of one of the paid events you host on The Platform,
        you
        will receive the following percentage of the sale before VAT: 90% (ninety percent). In the event that a user who
        is linked to another affiliate
        purchases a ticket to your event, you will receive 85% (eighty five percent) and
        they will receive their 5% (five percent) affiliate 'Sign-Up' cut. In the event that you, the event organiser,
        are affiliated to another account, your affiliate will also be entitled to the 5% (five percent) affiliate
        'Tournament' cut of any
        ticket sales you make
        through the platform. To clarify, this means that in the event the account hosting the platform (you) is
        affiliated to an account, and the ticket purchaser is also affiliated to an account, your final cut from ticket
        sales
        will be 80% (eighty percent); with 10% going to the platform, 5% going to the purchaser's affiliate (the
        affiliate 'Sign-Up' cut), and 5%
        going to the organiser's affiliate (the affiliate 'Tournament' cut).</p>
      <p>The maximum cut that you can receive from running a paid event is 90%
        (ninety percent) and this will be when neither the purchaser or the organiser is affiliated to another account.
